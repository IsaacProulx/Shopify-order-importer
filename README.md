# Shopify Order Importer
An app for importing orders from a csv file into your shopify store.
<b>This app is not complete, some features may not work correctly.</b> This app was built from a Shopify app template using the Shopify CLI: https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli.

## Running
You will need node.js to run this project: https://nodejs.org. You will also need a store to install the app on (I'd recommend testing this on a dev store: https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/development-stores).

Clone the repository (*git clone https://github.com/IsaacProulx/Shopify-order-importer.git*) then enter the root directory (*cd Shopify-order-importer*). In the root directory run (*npm install*) then run (*npm run dev*) and follow the instructions on screen.
